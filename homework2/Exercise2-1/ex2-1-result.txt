Summary: The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks first published in 1975, with subsequent editions in 1982 and 1995.

This idea is known as Brooks's law, and is presented along with the second-system effect and advocacy of prototyping.
